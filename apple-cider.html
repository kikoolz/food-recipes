                In a small saucepan, bring cider to a rapid boil; cook over high
                heat until reduced by half, about 12 minutes. Cool completely.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whisk together flours, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, baking
                soda and spices. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, melted butter
                and cooled cider; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened
                (dough will be sticky). Refrigerate, covered, until firm enough
                to shape, about 1 hour.
              </li>
              <li>
                Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, pat each portion to
                1/2-in. thickness; cut with a floured 3-in. doughnut cutter.
              </li>
              <li>
                In an electric skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 325Â°. Fry
                doughnuts, a few at a time, until golden brown, 2-3 minutes on
                each side. Fry doughnut holes, a few at time, until golden brown
                and cooked through, about 1 minute on each side. Drain on paper
                towels; cool slightly. If desired, dip doughnuts into glaze or
                sugar of your
